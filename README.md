CROP YIELD PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

Models Used: Decision Tree Regressor, Linear Regressor

Selected Model: Decision Tree Regressor

Decision Tree Regressor:Decision trees are another popular model for crop yield prediction, especially when the relationship 
                        between the input variables and the output variable is complex and non-linear.

Linear regression: This is a simple and interpretable model that can be used for crop yield prediction when the relationship 
                   between the input variables and the output variable is linear.
